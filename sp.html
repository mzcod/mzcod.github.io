            <h2>Using with port forwarding</h2>
            <p>By configuring a port forwarding rule using things like iptables or brook to the origin WireGuard server, it would still work.</p>
            <p>Useful for bypassing certain limits, like by setting up a forwarding server to <a href="https://engage.cloudflareclient.com/">engage.cloudflareclient.com</a> and using
                <a href="https://github.com/ViRb3/wgcf">wgcf</a>, it would be easy to bypass region limits on

            <h2>Encrypted private networking</h2>
            <p>Considering the fact that WireGuard is a VPN software, it would build a tunnel where you can securely exchange data between two devices under different NATs, just like in the same internal network. It could also be used for wrapping an insecure
                protocol, benefiting from its strong encryption.</p>
